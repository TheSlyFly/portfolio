# Udacity Project - No. 1
This is a school project, a work in progress.
Also it is my first 'situation' on github.com, my first experience with git and github.
Wish me luck ...
Taking the FrontEnd nano degree with Udacity, it dawned on me pretty quickly that this was going to be a longer journey than I expected. 
You see, I already do know quite a bit about HTML and CSS, or so I thought, so this is gonna be a breeze, right? Wrong!
One project in, Project 0 as it happens, I realize, that having your own selfhosted wordpress web-site ain't gonne cut it. 
Before I can finish Project 1, I shall have to get acquainted with CodePen, Git, GitHub (didn't even know there is a difference), and much more.
Hard work ahead! 
I love it :-)
